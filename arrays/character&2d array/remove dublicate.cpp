For a given string(str), remove all the consecutive duplicate characters.

Example:
Input String: "aaaa"
Expected Output: "a"

Input String: "aabbbcc"
Expected Output: "abc"

Â Input Format:
The first and only line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces. All the characters in the string would be in lower case.

Output Format:
The only line of output prints the updated string.

Note:
You are not required to print anything. It has already been taken care of.

Constraints:
0 <= N <= 10^6
Where N is the length of the input string.

Time Limit: 1 second

Constraints:
0 <= N <= 10^6
